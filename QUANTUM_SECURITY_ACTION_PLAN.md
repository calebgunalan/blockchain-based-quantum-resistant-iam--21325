# Quantum Security Action Plan

## Current Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è VULNERABLE TO QUANTUM ATTACKS

### Critical Vulnerabilities Identified:

#### 1. Authentication Flow (HIGH PRIORITY - CRITICAL)
- ‚ùå Password-based auth uses classical hashing (vulnerable to Grover's algorithm)
- ‚ùå Session tokens use standard JWT/cookies (vulnerable to Shor's algorithm)
- ‚ùå No post-quantum key exchange during authentication
- ‚ùå MFA uses standard TOTP (not quantum-resistant)

#### 2. Data Protection (HIGH PRIORITY)
- ‚ùå No hybrid encryption for sensitive data at rest
- ‚ùå API keys use classical crypto
- ‚ùå Database connections not quantum-protected
- ‚ùå File uploads/downloads not using post-quantum encryption

#### 3. Key Management (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- ‚ùå No automated post-quantum key generation on user signup
- ‚ùå No key rotation policies enforced
- ‚ùå Private keys stored without quantum-safe encryption
- ‚ùå No Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration

#### 4. Attack Detection (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- ‚ùå No quantum attack pattern detection active
- ‚ùå No behavioral analytics for quantum threat indicators
- ‚ùå No device fingerprinting with quantum signatures
- ‚ùå No trust score calculation system active

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Quantum-Protect Authentication (WEEK 1) ‚úÖ IN PROGRESS
- [x] Install post-quantum cryptography libraries
- [x] Create hybrid crypto wrapper (classical + PQC)
- [x] Create post-quantum security hooks
- [ ] **Integrate PQ crypto into authentication flow**
- [ ] **Add quantum-protected session tokens**

- [ ] **Implement hybrid encryption for passwords**

### Phase 2: Activate Security Monitoring (WEEK 2)
- [ ] Enable automatic device fingerprinting on login
- [ ] Implement real-time trust score calculation
- [ ] Activate quantum attack detection
- [ ] Set up behavioral analytics tracking
- [ ] Configure automated threat response

### Phase 3: Data Encryption (WEEK 2-3)
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive DB columns with hybrid crypto
- [ ] Implement quantum-safe API key generation
- [ ] Add PQC to file upload/download flows
- [ ] Secure database connections with PQC

### Phase 4: Key Management (WEEK 3-4)
- [ ] Implement automated key rotation
- [ ] Add key escrow for compliance
- [ ] Set up key recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Implement HSM integration planning

### Phase 5: Audit & Compliance (WEEK 4)
- [ ] Enable comprehensive audit logging
- [ ] Generate compliance reports
- [ ] Security assessment and penetration testing
- [ ] Documentation and training

## Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Integrate PQ Security into Auth Flow** - Make quantum protection mandatory
2. **Auto-populate Security Tables** - Trigger-based data generation
3. **Enable Attack Detection** - Activate monitoring systems
4. **Hybrid Encryption** - Protect all sensitive operations

## Risk Assessment:

**Current Risk Level: HIGH** üî¥

Without post-quantum protection in the authentication flow:
- Passwords can be harvested and decrypted later
- Sessions can be hijacked using quantum computers
- All encrypted data is at risk
- API keys vulnerable to quantum attacks

**Target Risk Level: LOW** üü¢ (After full implementation)

## Success Metrics:

- ‚úÖ 100% of authentication flows use hybrid PQC
- ‚úÖ All sessions quantum-protected
- ‚úÖ Device fingerprinting active for 100% of logins
- ‚úÖ Trust scores calculated for all users
- ‚úÖ Attack detection monitoring 100% of operations
- ‚úÖ All API keys quantum-safe
- ‚úÖ Automated key rotation functional
- ‚úÖ Zero quantum vulnerabilities in security scan
